## An L5R discord bot system for managing characters and rolls.

While this system was originally written for the City of Lies game, it is (in its entirety) open source. The system, in abstract, takes a specific format google sheet's published xlsx file and turns it into a javascript class. That is all that happens at present. I have no idea how often this readme will be updated because I am notoriously bad at commenting and documenting.
